# C++ - Essentials

    Here I'm practicing the essenctials to develop with C++. Although very similiar to my C language coding I'm focusing on the 
    different key words to properly transfer functionalities. The goal of this project is to develop visuals and animations using
    C++ and implement more advanced programming math equations to coding.
